📘 Employee Management System – SQL Project

This project is a complete SQL-based Employee Management System built using MySQL.
It covers database creation, table design, data insertion, constraints, joins, CRUD operations, salary updates, analytical queries, and advanced SQL functions.

🔹 📂 Database Used

The database used in this project:

CREATE DATABASE employee_management_systems;
USE employee_management_systems;

🧱 1. Database Schema Overview

This system contains four main tables:

1️⃣ Departments

Stores department information.

DepartmentID (PK)
DepartmentName

2️⃣ Employees

Stores employee details.

EmployeeID (PK)
FirstName
LastName
DepartmentID (FK)
HireDate
Salary

3️⃣ Projects

Stores project information.

ProjectID (PK)
ProjectName
DepartmentID (FK)
StartDate
EndDate

4️⃣ EmployeeProjects (Junction Table)

Maps employees to projects (Many-to-Many relation).

EmployeeID (FK)
ProjectID (FK)
Primary Key: (EmployeeID, ProjectID)

🧪 2. Data Inserted
✔ Departments

You inserted 5 departments:

Human Resources

Finance

IT

Marketing

Operations

✔ Employees

Each department has multiple employees with:

EmployeeID

First & Last Name

DepartmentID

HireDate

Salary (after adding the Salary column)

✔ Projects

Each project belongs to a department:

Sales System

Employee Tracker

Inventory App

Customer Report

Finance Tool

Then you renamed all projects to new names (using UPDATE).

✔ EmployeeProjects

You assigned employees to different projects using the junction table.

⚙️ 3. Schema Modifications

You added salary to employee table:

ALTER TABLE Employees 
ADD Salary DECIMAL(10,2);


Then you inserted base salary values for all employees.

💰 4. Salary Updates
Increase salary of HR department by 8%
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary * 1.08
WHERE DepartmentID = 1;

Increase salary of IT department by 10%
UPDATE Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
SET e.Salary = e.Salary * 1.10
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'IT';

📊 5. Queries & Reports Included

Your SQL file includes a full analytics section, such as:

✔ Average salary of all employees
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS average_salary FROM Employees;

✔ Employees with their project names (using joins)
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, p.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID;

✔ Project with the longest duration

Using DATEDIFF().

✔ Count employees in each department
GROUP BY DepartmentID

✔ Employees working on more than one project

Using HAVING COUNT() > 1.

✔ Department with highest total salary
ORDER BY TotalSalary DESC LIMIT 1;

✔ Salary ranking inside each department

Using window function:

DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC)

✔ Employees not assigned to any project

Using LEFT JOIN and NULL filter.

✔ Department with highest average project duration
✔ Categorizing salary into Low / Medium / High

Using CASE statement.

✔ Top 5 highest salaries

Using ORDER BY + LIMIT.

✔ Delete employees hired before 2019

A cleanup operation.

🧠 6. Advanced SQL Concepts Used

Your project demonstrates:

✔ Primary Keys

✔ Foreign Keys

✔ Many-to-many relationships

✔ INNER JOIN

✔ LEFT JOIN

✔ GROUP BY

✔ HAVING

✔ ORDER BY

✔ LIMIT

✔ Window Functions

✔ Aggregates (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)

✔ DATEDIFF

✔ CASE expression

✔ UPDATE + JOIN

✔ DELETE filtering

This makes the project industry standard for SQL portfolio practice.
